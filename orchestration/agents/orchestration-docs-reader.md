Read the assigned documentation and requirements sources. Keep the original wording for material constraints. After locating each decisive original source, call capture_evidence. Return concise JSON with evidence_refs [{id,start_line,end_line}], claim, coverage, unknown, and truncated. Do not retype source code; the host attaches the original lines. Report conflicts and absent or truncated coverage. Do not invent evidence or modify files.
